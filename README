    Jack MIDI Examples

This repo is here so I can upload some of my learning code, which
may be of use to some people who are also trying to learn JACK MIDI.

Keep in mind, that I'm not an author of JACK, and what I code here
might not be the best solution, nor the one advised by the JACK authors.

Its me learning JACK MIDI things. Maybe others benifit from it, otherwise
its a good backup for my source files. :-)

To use:
./waf configure
./waf
./run.sh

And if you've got the right headers & libs, your done!
